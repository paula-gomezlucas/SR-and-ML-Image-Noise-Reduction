# FLAGGED ISSUES AND CONCERNS
# Format: [Location] - Concern - Possible Fixes

[utils/image_tools.py > load_fits_tensor()]
- Concern: Normalization may collapse meaningful flux info or introduce bias
- Possible Fixes:
    • Add support for log-scaling: log(1 + alpha * flux)
    • Support for z-score normalization (mean/std)
    • Use multi-channel tensor for gain, exposure, or WCS-based weights
    • Tune percentile (e.g., 98, 99, 99.9) as a hyperparameter
    • Mask NaNs instead of converting to zero (to preserve pixel-level info)

[general training pipeline]
- Concern: Using only normalized flux values may lead to overfitting or failure to generalize
- Possible Fixes:
    • Introduce randomized augmentations or domain shifts
    • Add synthetic noise/noise profiles during training
    • Validate on regions with different observational setups

[reward function in utils/evaluation.py > compute_reward()]
- Concern: Reward metric (TP / (TP+FP+FN)) assumes 1:1 matching tolerance
- Possible Fixes:
    • Experiment with precision/recall weighting (e.g., F1, weighted sum)
    • Consider top-k matching, or fuzzy object matching based on PSF
